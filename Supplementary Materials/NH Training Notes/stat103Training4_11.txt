103 Modual

Topic:

- finsh by with problem set question 6
- egen
- problem set question 3 in egen modual
- talk about topics in 104 modual


Questions:

- 


Suggestions:

- use this as a problem set question for the egen modual after finding the total number of literate per surveyor
	 What is the average number of literate person per surveyor?
         extract the first and sum those values to find the mean

- don't use rowmiss as a example when using egen while talking because it gives the answer to the problem set question.
- like to discuss the outlier in missing values in exampl for problem set question 3 it was 78
- Can ask why it does not make sense to us by with egen.
- logical expression should be in 103 instead of 104


Good Coding practice:

egen rowmiss(varlist)  - used in data cleaning alot


Next Time:

- start 104 modual
