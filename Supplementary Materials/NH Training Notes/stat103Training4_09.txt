103 Modual

Topic:
-By command when using _n and _N
-Problem set question 4 and 5 of by modual
-How does the sort command work in a loop.  Does the it sort age than sort survey? Or is the sorting random?  Where are the ties?
 


Questions:

1. Why is sex in parenteses when using the bysort command?
2. Why is _N in brackets?
3. What does [1] mean?
4. If we had 3 ages for value of 1 in hhid would it generate the proper _N?
5. What happens if it is duplicate for example in suggestion section?
6. What is the example trying to do (again look loop in suggestion section)?
7. Why is [_N] refering to the last observation in the tied group?
8. What would [_n] be in the example in the suggestion section?
9. Would another way to find hhid duplicate be to use [_n] and [_N]?
10. What is the difference between having _N and _n vs. [_N] and [_n]?
11. What would s be? bysort hhid: gen s=_N
12  what would s be? bysort hhid (age): gen s=age[1]

Suggestions:

-very important (confusing example that has to be explained slowly)

 foreach var of varlist _all {
        bysort hhid (`var'): generate unequal = `var'[1] != `var'[_N]
        list hhid `var' if unequal == 1
        drop unequal
    }

-example above is trying to find differences in duplicate hhid
- _N is the number of observation in the by groups


Good Coding practice:

- drop temporary variable generated in a loop
- with subcripting you cannot use a space with the variable and the subscript


Next Time:

go over problem set question 6 of by module



Note: from stata training in the morning with Joyce and Steve

-- its a good coding practice to use the if qualifier when generating variables
   Key when missing observations are part of the dataset
