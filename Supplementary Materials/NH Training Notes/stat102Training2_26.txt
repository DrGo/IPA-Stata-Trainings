1-hour Stata Sessions

Modual: 102

Topics: Merging, appending, relative references, how to use SMCL

Note: Topic of merging is in 102 manual and the dataset (intro_imported.dta) is in the intro & intermedate

-


Suggestions:

- In the 102 traning word file it would be good to show that when appening,
	variables in the using that are not in the master will make the dataset
wider and will




Questions:

1. How would having multiple observations for the merge variable in one data set affect merging?
2. How would you always know when the matching has taken place correctly?
3. What would be an easier way to see in the merged data set that name is the same as name_eduline?
4. Do you have to check th data before appending?
5. What happens when you append variables that are not in the master?
6. why do we not care about ranvars?



Recommended Coding Practice:

-Before merging, it is good to check if the variable used in the merge is unique
	-figure out what type of merge you want to perform

-always check the merge after merging
	-tabulate _merge variable
	-look through the data
