104 Modual


Topic:
-save results modua
-problem set question 5 
 -duplicates tag
 -duplicates drop
-quietly
-noisily

Questions:
1. why would you not want to see the results of a command?
2. When will you use noisely?
3. can you ruin someone's saved results using pi?


Suggestions:
-check SMCL file, someone had trouble opening it.  Would open but show no content.
 -the individual files were not working
-Should add a brief discussion on when to use noisely (look at stat pdf help file)


Good Coding practice:
