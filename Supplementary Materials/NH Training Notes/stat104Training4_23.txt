104 Modual

Topic:
-logical expression and creating dummy variables
-saved results (return list and ereturn list)
-ds commands (describe simple)



Questions:
1. What is an advantage of creating a conditional instaed of creating a new variable?
2. Should we be reading about factor variables?
3. If add observation to a varable would I have to rerun the do-file to update the saved results?
4. Why did r(p1), r(p2), ..., r(p99) not display when we display return list?
5. Is seperator(#) a useful option?
6. The code ds truncates the variables names, how would we get around this?


Suggestions:
-problem set question: (generate female=sex==2 ) what will happend if sex has missing values? in the case of generating a variable but not using conditional
Conditional allows you to specified missing

-need a modual xi: i. how to create dummy using factor variables
-drop cyclenumstd in module for top example

-good exercise to compare the list to see what variables are in one variable and not the other.

- in stata 13 if you do the r(varlist) with single quotes verus double quotes you will not see a difference
-

Good Coding practice:
-using conditoional allows you have other values besides 1 or 0 for the dummy variable
-



Next Time:

using quotes when using saved results
 
save results in loops

duplicates
