 -question 1
 -question 3
 -question 5

-sum (min/max)



Questions:
1. Before using duplicates drop should we check the duplicates first?
2. Why is only one observation is dropped and not all the duplicate ids?
3. How do you rename all variables?
4. When get an invalid message that the variable name is too long?
5. Whould the dot have to be in quotation or no?
6. Is the best way to create a new variables in two lines?
7. 


Suggestions:
-Probably take out the helpful hint for question 5(b) labeling question.



Good Coding practice:

-Do not use the observation number when writing code because the observation number can change
-variable names are limited to 32 characters
-Better to keep the replace command when generating variables and changing the values
