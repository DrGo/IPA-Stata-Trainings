103 Modual

Topic: 
 
-review Explicit Subscripting, For-Loops, Tracing
-section 3.3 More on Macros
 *globals
 *locals
-using a local to count



Questions:

1. Do you have to use `i' when establishing the local or can we call `i' anything?
2. Is there a way to see the Mata code?
3. Why do we not learn -trace- in Stata 101?
4. what is the point of -set more off-?
5. For globals, do you need the double quotes?
6. Do globals works when you open another instance of stata and call it in the do-file?
7. When you are making a local list, why do you need two double quotes
8. Do you need double quote when you define a maro?
9. When you create a local and do not use quotes why when you loop does it go through each value in the local
10. when you create a local how does it save it?


Suggestions:

-For the Trace example probable use another example becuase the current one is a bit too easy
-Take a lot at the command -include-
-For the technical tip involving locals it might be easier to type the example in the command window
-take a look at sincle quotes and double quotes in a local



Good Coding practice:

-debuging large dataset

. set trace on                    /* turn on tracing */
. set more off                    /* turn off --more-- */
. log using junk, replace         /* start a log */
. invoke program


Output will scroll by without --more-- ever appearing. Eventually, the error will occur. Then,


. log close
. set more on                   /* turn back on --more-- */
. set trace off                 /* turn off trace */

-set trace on only when you use it and make sure to set trace off once you finish using
-set more off permantely but also includes -set more off- at the top of due file
