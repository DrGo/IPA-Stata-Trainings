{pstd}{bf:Question 1}

{hline}

{pstd}Suppose we have a subset of a dataset of 2011 IPA expense reports.
(Don't worry, the data is fake.)

{phang}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/New Hampshire 2013 projects 1", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}The dataset is sorted by employee ({cmd:id}) and the date of the ER ({cmd:date}):

{phang}{bf:{stata `"isid id date"'}}{p_end}
{phang}{bf:{stata `"browse"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}However, the projects variables are a mess.
They were taken directly from the ER,
so the values are ordered according to how they were entered in the ER.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Sort across the project variables,
so that {cmd:project1} is an employee's alphabetically first project,
{cmd:project2} the second, and so on.
(The project variables are numeric,
but the values of the value label are sorted by project text:
{bf:{stata label list project}})
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:projectchange} that is {cmd:1}
if an employee's list of projects changed since their last ER,
and {cmd:0} otherwise.
There are multiple approaches to {bf:(b)}!
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(c)}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:anychange} that is {cmd:1}
if an employee made any project change in 2011,
and {cmd:0} otherwise. How many IPAers changed projects in 2011?

{hline}{marker q2}

{pstd}{bf:Question 2}

{hline}

{pstd}For variables that are lists, such as {cmd:projects},
{cmd:reshape} allows manipulation beyond sorting.

{pstd}The following is a dataset of one variable, {cmd:s2_q8},
a question that allowed respondents to choose up to 4 of 12 possible options:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/New Hampshire 2013 s2_q8", clear"'}}{p_end}

{phang}{bf:{stata `"browse"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}You can see that {cmd:s2_q8} is already internally sorted.
However, it's still not possible to use the variable for analysis.

{pstd}Using {cmd:reshape}, create dummy variables for all 12 options.
For each value, if a list contains that value, the value's dummy variable should equal {cmd:1};
otherwise it should equal {cmd:0}. For example:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"list in 1"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}In observation 1, the dummy variable for option {cmd:1} would equal {cmd:0},
since the list does not contain {cmd:1}.
However, the dummy variable for option {cmd:5} would equal {cmd:1}.
