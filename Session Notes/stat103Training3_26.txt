103 Modual

Topic: 

-103 Problem set question 3 of Forloops and Macros
-if Command vs. the if Qualifier
-problem set question a, b, and c




Questions:

1. when using if as a qualifer it not an option?
2. What would it look like if we used the if statement the other way for part b. of problem set question 1? 
(useing local with the if qualifer) e.g. summarize sex if 1==1
3. Is there anther way to do the problem set question without using the observation number?
4. How do you use count?
5. 


Suggestions:
-question on part b of the problem set question 1 for if command vs. if qualifier
-rewrite the problem set question 1 in the if command vs. if qualifier.  Clean up language.

Good Coding practice:

-display does not take if as an option
-When you have a brace in a line for a loop it is good coding practice to indent
