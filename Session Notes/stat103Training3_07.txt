103 Modual

Topic: 
 
- Foreach x of varlist
- Explicit Subscripting
- sorting and than looking at the value of the explicit subscripting
- For-Loops
 *foreach var in
- locals
- macro
- trace



Questions:
1. After the foreach statment do I put the variable name?
2. why do we need double quote in the example foreach loop?
3. How would the loop work if you put a local in the loop? Is that something you should not do?
4. Which way will you use "in" in a foreach loop?
5. why with the example the missing values for sex and age do not show up?
6. when using display in the loop it will evaluate the expression before doing the display?
7. how does Stata read `var?
8. Is the trace running through each line?
9. 


Suggestions:

- expand on varlist using the * in the foreach statement, might want
to include this in with the rename command

- put the value of the local for the number values
- Stata has improved on infrom the error in the code but using trace is still imporatant
- 

Good Coding practice:
- why not to use the observation numbers
- when writing a loop it is stylistically nice to indent the code until the end bracket
- resource on Box on programing style
- every loop will have a macro but not all marcro will have a loop
