Starttime 3:30pm


Introdution:

Resources --> 3:31pm - 3:39pm (talk about resources/how to read help file e.g. the help, tabulate, in, if)


Variables types & working with string variables:

variable type (numeric/string) --> 3:40pm - 3:49pm

destring --> 3:50pm - 4:00pm

encode/decode --> 4:01pm - 4:09pm


Macro & Loops: 

Macro (Locals) --> 4:10pm - 4:37pm

Loops (for loops) --> 4:38pm - 5:03pm

Last Questions --> 5:04pm - 5:06pm




Sugesstions:

*forgot chapter 4
*title of handout is wanky
*Stata 10 does not give you the same help 
*You talk about using the command describe and codebook or look at the properties window but
probaly display how to use all three methods when working through activity.
* Talk about the alternatives to useing replace (e.g. ignor)
*practice backing up dataset, other files for trainng. Talk about this in the beging of the training.
* have all files setup for them for the training
*Easier to have the command window open
*have practice having the do-file open and get into the habit of working in the do-file
*use destring you have to specify if you want it to change to missing
*mention tostring but it was not shown as an example with doing destring
*for macros are you only focusing on local or both local and global (Will not talk about other macros here)
*The slant quote is not single quote.  Have to differianciate bewteen the two. (called forward quotes)
*Should talk about what the varaibles means and how they are labled
*Find out when to use douple quotes when assigning locals
* Might want to talk about assigning an same name to two different locals (talk about overwitting local later)
* the equal sign is not negligable (e.g. local i = `i'+ 3). Tale about when using local in an operation
* Might want to talk about why you have to have the open bracket and press enter then close bracket on its own line
* Typo in example when using "foreach" example
* The variables names in example are different than the ones in the dataset
* Might want to change the example (e.g. gen schooltype1-1 = (schooltype1 ==1) because you start talking about logical expression but never introduced this concept.
* Stata independent study from wendsday 11am-12pm use an 1hour to go part of manual

Questions:

1. What are the different storage types of variables e.g. float, byte? Do we need to know these different types?
2. Was it householdid or childid?
3. How does destring treat nondigit like a letter?
4. How is the syntix using replace, gen() do you need the perenteses?
5. What happen when you rewite and want to go back?
6. Are we going to go over foreach?
7. There is no undo command?
8. When using encode do you lose the values or do you have to generate a new variable
9. If you use destring on a non-numberic it does not just change a variable as missing?
10. Would it be fine after encoding to drop tcstatus?
11. who labled the names of quotes?
12. what is the point of generate one uisng local?
13. should there be double quotes around the local i (e.g. "`i'" instead `i')?
14. why would it do the middle part first (e.g. display "`a`1''")
15. when you call (local a a1 a2 a3), Is it a string or a number?
16. when you generate the variable you generate the string? Right?
17. It would not be a good procatice to redefine locals because it is obnotious to the person trying to follow your code?
18. Chances of changing a global would be rarely? Right?
19. what is SMCL?
20. Can you think of a way to make this easier which fequency table corresponds to which variables in a loop?
21. How is using loops useful?
22. Can you create a list of variables in a local? How would you go about doing that? 
23. Without loops how would you go about create a dummy for each group of observations in a variable?
24. when you doing variables var1 to var20 are they names in the dataset or numbers?
25. when is stata 103 training?
