104 Modual


Topic:
-returning results using quotes and double quotes
-using single quotes in a foreach loop
- _all
- limiting the number of variales in your loop using ds
- problem set question 4 of modual saved results


Questions:
1. why does it not have 24 character quotes when you use r(varlist) in double quotes?
2. why would you create a local outside the loop but not inside the loop?
3. 

Suggestions:
-problem set question: How would you see what r(min) and r(max) actually are?
set trace on

-problem set question: Why are we using 'in' instead of 'of' in the foreach loop when you using saved results r(varlist)?
- talked about 'in' and 'of' and when it will and will not work
-

Good Coding practice:
-no harm in putting single quotes around r(mean), but sometimes they are required.
for example when they are used in a loop
It depends on what is saved results but this is no longer true for stata 13
-you should never see an expression in foreach loop
