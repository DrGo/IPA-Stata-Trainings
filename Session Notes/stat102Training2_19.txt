Questions:

1. When you rename a variables you erase the old name?
2. Do the ? and * function in the same way as the wild card?
3. when you look at the data and there are extra class and most of them are blanck, why is that?
4. Is it a bad idea to name the label the same as the variables?
5. How would you correct the label if you miss-spelled something in the label?
6. Where whould you use label option (modify, rename, add,nofix) if you are working in a do-file?
7. Do you always have to specify replace if you are relabeling variables?
8. Can you label a string or is the command only used for labeling numeric?
9. Is -insheet- obsolete?
10. The point when you are merging, does that mean you have taken out the names?
11. With merging, how do you know which is dataset one and dataset two.
12. With the merging if you have serveral unique ids and you want to merge than in the other dataset would you have one instance of the unique ids?
      -what is an example of when that would happen.
13. When you merge, do you want all merge 3?
14. 



Suggestions:

-get a general sense of the data to know what the variables mean to make the cleaning easier or what should be cleaned
-rename variables, it might be good to go in more dept.
-the merging file does not open when you go through the Kenya 2014 training file/it open when you use the smcl file
