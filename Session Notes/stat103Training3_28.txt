103 Modual

Topic:
- _N 
- r(r)
- _n



Questions:
1. _N gives the number of observations and r(r) give the number of unique observations?
2. Will you ever see _N in a foreach loop?
3. How can we use smcl and a do-file at the same time?
4. Is there any case when using _n in example
sort hhid
generate iddup = hhid[_n - 1]
 
will fail spectacularly?
5. Why would you not just do duplicate tag in the first place than using _n?
6. 



Suggestions:
- come up with examples of using _N in a loop or in another way
- Need logical experession in 103
- what if there is a duplicate in the last observation what will happen.
- we need to talk about the -count- command


Good Coding practice:





Next Time:

We will see _N in 104
r(r) will also be seen in 104
finsh problem set 4 of the _n
