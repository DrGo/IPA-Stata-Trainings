103 Modual

Topic: 
-the difference between in and of in loops
-reviewed problem set question 1 & 2 of the For-loops and Macro modual
-problem set question 3 of the For-loops and Macros

 


Questions:

1. In for-loop does 'of' allways goes with varlist and 'in' goes with numlist?
2. When creating a dummy variable how do you specify it in one line?
3. Does the logical expression always have to have parentesis?
4. 



Suggestions:

-answer explanation for the problem set question in the for-loop and Macro module needs to be clearified
-go over the other anwers for the problem set questions to see if more explanction can be added
-The question and answer for part b of problem set question 

Good Coding practice:

-always use double quotes when refering to a string
-do not need quote when defining the local in a loop
