As a Stata pro, you are already very comfortable with essential Stata concepts,
such as the following:

Explicit subscripting{BR}
For-loops and macros{BR}
The {helpb ifcmd:if} command vs. the {helpb if} qualifier{BR}
Saved results{BR}
{helpb _N}{BR}
{helpb _n}{BR}
{helpb by}{BR}
{helpb egen}

Thus, the purpose of this course is not to train you on essentials like these,
but instead to fill any gaps in your knowledge,
to extend your deep understanding of Stata,
and to present the most efficient solutions to common data tasks.

This course is meant to be challenging,
and if you are not already very familiar with the essential concepts above,
you should join the High Intermediate training now.
High Intermediate is a rigorous course and
is designed to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

This training is split into two modules.
While all Stata beginners start the same,
Stata pros can have different skill sets from one another.
While you may know the content of one module very well,
you could be less familiar with the other.
We will cover the following modules:

{MACROS}
  o {MACROS_ANS2}
{RESHAPE}
  o {RESHAPE_ANS2}

The training material is written in SMCL (pronounced "smickle"), Stata's output language.
Since multiple SMCL files will be used, your working directory needs to be set correctly using {cmd:cd}.
Now, {bf:{ul:set your working directory to the directory that contains this SMCL file.}}
If you opened this file by double-clicking on it, you probably don't need to change your working directory.

Before embarking on the first module,
let's do a brief introduction to the training and its format:
