Thanks to Harrison Diamond Pollock, who wrote many of the problem set questions
and helped edit the training.
Thanks also to Niall Keleher, Gean Spektor, and Jeffery McManus
for valuable contributions to the course.

This is an advanced, applied Stata training. It builds off of the concepts presented
in {bf:Stata 103} and covers data management, cleaning, and checking.
There are 6 modules in total, most of which contain a number of problem set questions.
It has been developed for IPA and J-PAL staff use and has not been produced by Stata Corp.

{EXPORTING}

The training material is written in SMCL (pronounced "smickle"), Stata's output language.
Since multiple SMCL files will be used, your working directory needs to be set correctly using {cmd:cd}.
Now, {bf:{ul:set your working directory to the directory that contains this SMCL file.}}
If you opened this file by double-clicking on it, you probably don't need to change your working directory.
