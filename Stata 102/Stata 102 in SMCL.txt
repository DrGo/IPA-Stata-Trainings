TYPES
NAMING
LOCALS
LOOPS
EXPORTING
IMPORTING


**Need to update commands to download in introduction
**When first linking to a help file, (in Ch2 or beyond) mention it and link back to help section 

**Once PDFs are uploaded, link to individual modules - ***make PDFs for 101 as well, link to individual sections. \

**Verify links to other modules are correct 

Resources: removed 'SSC' as a resource (to leave in Commands section) and added a mention of the Stata manual 


102: Just intro to foreach in and loops in general. mention at the end about other loops, add in additional more complex example of forloop!! (from duplicates/types/labels)

***Check links to TYPES module so that it points to appropriate section within it, instead of just whole module

103: tracing, numlist/varlist, globals, while. 

**Modify psets!
