* Why does sort order matter when using explicit subscripting?

{PSQ:SUBSCRIPTING_Q2}

{USE}

/* Using explicit subscripting,
write a for-loop that displays the fifth and sixth values of the following variables:
{cmd:age}, {bf:educ}, and {bf:castename}.
Ensure that the data is sorted by {bf:hhid} beforehand.

Use the {cmd:browse} command to check your answer.

If you need a refresher on for-loops, visit the module on
{view `"{LOOPS-}"':for-loops and macros}. */
