/* Learning how to independently problem-solve in Stata
can help you (eventually!) become a Stata wiz.
Stata is not very difficult to learn – all you truly need
are enthusiasm and some resources. Hopefully, working on your
projects will motivate you to continue learning Stata.
With this in mind, this chapter introduces resources
available for your post-training Stata education.

The module is divided into introducing resources internal to IPA, those
that are external, and the Stata {cmd:help} command.

{bf:2. IPA Resources}

{hline}

IPA has developed a wealth of Stata related material (you're reading
an example of one right now!). These resources are collected under the
{bf:IPA_RESEARCH_RESOURCES} section on Box, and can be accessed
{browse "https://ipastorage.box.com/stata-resources":here}. 
Highlights include a number of useful {bf:Stata Journal}
{browse "https://ipastorage.box.com/s/8hwdztpfhriukrjhpfgg":articles}, guides
to best programming and research 
{browse "https://ipastorage.box.com/s/sjtzr2l7fqnk2i5q3jwk":processes}, 
and links to numerous Stata training 
{browse "https://ipastorage.box.com/s/m9a95qpg2sscer4bb3he": courses}.

As will be discussed in the following module on {view `"{COMMANDS-}"':commands}, 
there are a number of very useful IPA written commands that are also stored on Box.

An invaluable resource for many IPA staff is the Google group,
{browse "http://groups.google.com/group/randomhelp?hl=en":Random Help}.
It is a group for members of IPA/J-PAL and affiliates where you can ask
questions about data management and analysis (Stata-related or otherwise),
as well as other topics. When requesting membership,
identify yourself with your full name, organization, and country.
