/*Up until now, we have worked solely with variables in Stata.
A Stata dataset is simply a collection of variables, sets of values,
which can be manipulated and analyzed in a variety of ways. However,
when writing code, variables have a number of drawbacks. In this chapter,
we’ll introduce an essential Stata concept, that of the macro.
We’ll explore macros through one particular type, that of the local.  

What is a macro? A macro simply stores a single value, and if you need
to save a value for later, it's often more convenient to attach it to a
macro than to create an entire variable for it.  Macros also facilitate
more complex code in a way that variables don't -- we'll get to that.
